# ReactAuthenticationAPP
ReactAuthApp is a simple authentication system built with ReactJS. This project allows users to create an account (Sign Up) and log in using their credentials (Login).

The main goal of this app is to practice handling forms, managing local state with React hooks, basic input validation, and simulating data persistence using the browser's localStorage.
